                      Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows
Problem statement:

In a small project management team consisting of a Project Manager (Alice) and a Team Member (Bob), there is a need to efficiently manage project tasks and ensure accountability throughout the project lifecycle. The current system lacks clear role definitions, access controls, and a structured workflow, leading to confusion regarding task assignments and progress tracking.

Objectives:
•	Implement centralized user, group, and role management.
•	Define and enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
•	Automate workflows for user onboarding, role changes, and access requests.
•	Ensure secure, auditable access management aligned with compliance standards.
•	Reduce administrative overhead and minimize access-related errors.

Core Features:

User Management
•	Create, edit, deactivate, and delete user accounts.
•	Assign users to one or more groups.
•	Associate users with roles dynamically based on department or function.

Group Management
•	Logical grouping of users (e.g., HR, IT, Sales).
•	Inherited permissions from groups to users.
•	Group-based access assignment and reporting.

Role Management
•	Define roles with granular permissions (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
•	Role hierarchies (e.g., Senior roles inherit from junior ones).
•	Time-bound or conditional roles for temporary access.

Access Control
•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation.
•	Rule-based permission assignment (based on location, device, etc.).
•	Audit trails for access activities.

Workflow Automation
•	Onboarding/Offboarding workflow with approvals.
•	Access request workflow (self-service + manager approval).
•	Role change or privilege escalation requests.

Workflow Examples

User Onboarding Flow
•	HR creates a user profile
•	System assigns base roles
•	Manager approval
•	User gets access based on role
•	Audit trail created

Access Request Flow
•	User submits access request
•	Manager & Security team approval
•	Access granted with expiration

Reporting & Dashboards
•	Active users by group/role
•	Access anomalies and violations
•	Role usage frequency
•	Workflow approval timelines

Documentation & Support
•	Admin Guide
•	Developer API Reference
•	User Training Manual
